## Original Requirements

Develop a dark themed, web based Art Gallery called 'ConArtist' with built-in Ai that creates ultra-realistic paintings, displays them in the chic online art gallery so that the public can purchase prints of all of the artwork: once the user pays for the painting, an order is sent to an online printer and framer to be completed and then shipped to the customer.

## Project Name

con_artist_gallery

## Product Goals

- Create an intuitive and engaging dark-themed online art gallery
- Incorporate AI technology to generate and display ultra-realistic paintings
- Streamline the purchasing and fulfillment process for art prints

## User Stories

- As an art enthusiast, I want to browse a variety of AI-generated paintings in a virtual gallery so that I can select prints to purchase.
- As a customer, I want to easily pay for and order a framed print so that it is shipped directly to my address without any hassle.
- As a user, I want to experience a dark-themed user interface that is easy on the eyes and enhances the artwork.

## Competitive Analysis

- ArtStation: Platform for artists to showcase and sell their work, lacks AI-generated art.
- Saatchi Art: Offers a wide range of art pieces for sale, but no AI creation feature.
- DeviantArt: Community of artists with options to buy prints, no integrated AI art generation.
- Artfinder: Online marketplace for original art, not focused on AI art.
- Singulart: High-end art sales platform, no AI-generated artwork.
- ArtPal: Free gallery to sell art and prints, lacks AI integration.

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires the development of a web-based art gallery with a dark theme. The gallery should feature an AI capable of creating ultra-realistic paintings. The system must support an e-commerce functionality allowing users to purchase prints. Once a purchase is made, the order should be automatically processed with a partnered printer and framer, then shipped to the customer.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop an AI algorithm capable of generating ultra-realistic paintings.']
- ['P0', 'Implement a dark-themed user interface for the online gallery.']
- ['P0', 'Create a seamless e-commerce system for purchasing and order fulfillment.']
- ['P1', 'Integrate with an online printing and framing service provider.']
- ['P2', 'Ensure the website is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a minimalist dark theme with a focus on showcasing the art. Navigation will be intuitive, with a clear path to purchase and checkout. Artwork previews will be prominently displayed, and the AI's creations will be highlighted in a special featured section.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specifics of the AI's capabilities and the extent of its integration with the gallery need to be further defined. It's also unclear which online printer and framer partners will be used and how the integration will be managed.
